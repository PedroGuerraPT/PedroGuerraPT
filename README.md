Hi, my name is Pedro. Here are some random facts about me:

- My eyes are green, not blue
- I highly dislike onions, power tool drills and individuals with god complex
- I enjoy helping people, listening/making music, cooking, Homebrew, and messing with random software and technologies
- OS agnostic, I love them all
- I have worked previously as an iOS Software Developer, End-User Support Technician, DevOps Consultant, SRE, ATM Technician and Xerox Service Technician (yes, in that order)
- I am currently a proud Azure Support Engineer working at [@Microsoft](https://github.com/microsoft/), where I help people from all around the world with Docker, Java, .NET Core, NodeJS, PHP, Ruby, Ansible, Terraform, and all sort of wacky opensource libraries and 3rd Party programs
