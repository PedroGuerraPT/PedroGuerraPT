Hi, my name is Pedro. Here are some random facts about me:

- I enjoy helping people, listening/making music, cooking, Homebrew, and messing with random software and technologies
- I highly dislike onions, power tool drills and individuals with god complex
- OS agnostic, I love them all
- I am currently a proud Support Escalation Engineer working at Microsoft, where I help people from all around the world with Azure App Services and Docker, Java, .NET Core, NodeJS, PHP, Python, including all sort of wacky opensource libraries and 3rd Party programs
