Hi, my name is Pedro. I am currently a Support Engineer working at depot.dev helping customers avoiding development downtime. Here are some random facts about me:

- I enjoy helping people, listening to music, cooking, homebrew, and messing with random software and technologies
- I highly dislike onions, power tool drills and individuals with god complex
- OS agnostic, I like them all
